## About us

## Why this role is critical for us
We’re in the early stages of building our product. This role is instrumental in making our big vision real and bringing the product to market. You’ll be the primary engineer for our mobile app that engages and delights our users.

## What you get in return
You will receive a competitive salary with generous benefits that include health insurance, 401k, and lots more. But most importantly, you’ll work in an unmatched environment to learn and grow.

You’ll work directly with Kai Yen, VP Engineering, who’s been a hands-on technology executive for over a decade. Kai has founded several technology companies and led award-winning, cross-functional teams. 

You will make technical decisions, and provide significant input on customer needs and business direction.

## You have a mindset that welcomes...
* Putting yourself in users’ shoes and obsessing about why they behave the way they do
* Focusing on the details that matter, and not sweating those that don’t
* Learning whatever new skills are required to reach a desired goal
* Taking ownership of outcomes and welcoming accountability
* Enjoying working on anything that moves the team forward, engineering or not

## You bring these skills and experiences to the team...
* Strong knowledge of modern JavaScript and TypeScript
* Experience building and deploying mobile apps to Apple and Google app stores
* Experience with mobile app location services
* Experience with React Native and Expo with OTA updates
* Experience with mobile analytics, offline usage, in-app notifications
* Experience building REST or GraphQL endpoints

## You and the team are successful together if...
* You deploy a mobile app to end users within the first 30-45 days
* We collect valuable learnings from users’ experiences
* You iterate on the app several times per week from those learnings
* We measure an increase in user engagement and happiness as a result

## Our hiring process
If you’ve read this far and are excited for the opportunity, we would love to hear from you. Our process starts with a 15 minute video call to get to know each other. After that you’ll get a chance to talk with the entire (but small) team and go through a technical interview. Our goal is for the process to be meaningful but as brief as possible.

Please email resumes to Kai Yen, VP Engineering at kai@onradius.com. We look forward to hearing from you!
